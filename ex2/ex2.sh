# TASK 1: USE CMSDRIVER TO SHOWER PRE-EXISTING LHE
# GOALS:
# 1) Students understand how to use config fragments and cmsDriver
# 2) Students understand need for parton showering and its implications: Much larger number of particles in each event, much larger event size, pt(W) now non-zero
#

# TASK 2: JET MULTIPLICITY MERGING
# We provide a pre-created gridpack for W+0/1/2 jets
# Students run LHE,GEN steps with cmsDriver.py

#   How are the cards different?
#   How many subprocesses does the process have? How does the computing time to create the gridpack change?

# Now, we run LHE and GEN steps straight from gridpack
# Previously, we ran LHE manually from the gridpack, but CMSSW can do that for us
